 		 	  	 <p>After writing multiple entrance level exams, Aayush scored pretty good marks in almost all of them, and was having multiple options of college to get admission in. IIIT Naya Raipur is becoming very popular in the state as the institute is giving back to back 100% placement stats, and also because of its advance curriculum and the DSAI brach the students from the institute were doing really well. so, Aayush wanted to pursue B.Tech from IIIT Naya Raipur as it as very great coding culture. So, he applied for CSE course in IIIT Naya Raipurs admission process but somehow he could not secure CSE branch in the merit list, instead he got ECE branch. Aayush thought of going ahead with ECE and then applying for branch upgradation process. After waiting for a couple of days the branch finally got upgraded to DSAI (DATA SCIENCE & ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.</p>
